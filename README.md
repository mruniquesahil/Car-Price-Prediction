# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the price of a car based on various features using Machine Learning. It provides an interactive user interface built with Streamlit, making it easy for users to input details and get real-time predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy – Numerical computations
- Matplotlib – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation
- Joblib – Model saving/loading
- Streamlit – Web application framework

## 💡 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed car dataset
- Trained regression model using Scikit-learn
- Model saved with Joblib for efficient loading
- Interactive Streamlit web app for prediction
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Real-time price prediction based on input features
